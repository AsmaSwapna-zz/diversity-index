<a id="diversity-index" class="anchor" href="#diversity-index" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Diversity-Index</h1>

<p>Women are <strong>half</strong> the world's population and despite the uproar over the lack of <strong>diversity</strong> in the Computer Science field, they hardly get any financial support for higher studies or opportunities to attend conferences. There are attempts to bridge this gap with grants in highly developed nations, especially in North America, Europe and other first-world countries. There are hardly any avenues for helping women from low- and middle-income countries living in the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/49483614.pdf">Least Developed Countries</a> (LDCs) as defined by the United Nations (UN). </p>

<p>This repo is an attempt to measure the <strong>international diversity index</strong> when we talk of <strong>diversity</strong> and <strong>women</strong> - words that should encompass women from ALL over the world, but a disparity of unequal proportions is created when diversity grants and financial aid are restricted to women who are citizens of the <em>first-world developed</em> countries that have a higher earning parity based on their gross national income (GNI). Altruism to women who already enjoy facilities and privileges that women living in a third world country dont have access to, nor dream of, creates a dichotomy of unequals and this invisible inequality is deliberately ignored and never quantified by <code>women-in-tech</code> groups.</p>

<p>FOSS has a <strong>"diversity"</strong> scarcity, a problem made more prominent due to the <strong>lack of a CoC</strong>, rather the reluctance to adopt one and implement it uniformly across all online FOSS communities within every country, resulting in a free pass to sexism, misogyny and online harassment, thereby directly impacting diversity. The <strong>leaky pipeline</strong> problem, wherein existing women leave tech due to misogyny, harassment, subtle sexism and/or unequal pay and promotions, but are forced to remain silent due to the lack of a support system, is hardly ever accounted for. </p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://svaksha.github.io/diversity-index">diversity-index</a></strong> is a curated list of grants, scholarships, travel bursary and/or financial aid offered to women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) from <strong>ALL around the world</strong>, by conferences and companies sponsoring education to encourage diversity in STEM fields among <strong>half the world's population</strong>. To measure <code>diversity</code> accurately, lets first quantify <strong>how</strong> much help is actually available to women across the world from the following pages:</p>

<h4>
<a id="guidelines-for-listing-events" class="anchor" href="#guidelines-for-listing-events" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Guidelines for listing Events</h4>

<ul>
<li>This is NOT a generic list of events or conferences, hence, <strong>only those conferences/ events that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) will be listed</strong>. </li>
<li>Please dont list events that expect women to have protracted <code>diversity</code> discussions with the organizers to initiate the FA/grants programs as this places an extra burden on women to do the legwork of making their conference a success instead of <code>diversity</code> being a community effort. Reading <a href="https://github.com/ashedryden" class="user-mention">@ashedryden</a> 's article on "<a href="http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference">Increasing Diversity at Your Conference</a>" will give you a perspective of the challenges women in FOSS/IT face. </li>
<li>Please dont list research grants that promote ageism and/or discriminate and/or restrict applicants on the basis of age, if this information is known or publicly available. </li>
</ul>
