There are attempts to bridge this gap with grants in highly developed nations, especially in North America, Europe and other first-world countries. There are hardly any avenues for helping women from low- and middle-income countries living in the [Least Developed Countries](https://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/49483614.pdf) (LDCs) as defined by the United Nations (UN). \r\n\r\nThis repo is an attempt to measure the __international diversity index__ when we talk of __diversity__ and __women__ - words that should encompass women from ALL over the world, but a disparity of unequal proportions is created when diversity grants and financial aid are restricted to women who are citizens of the _first-world developed_ countries that have a higher earning parity based on their gross national income (GNI). Altruism to women who already enjoy facilities and privileges that women living in a third world country dont have access to, nor dream of, creates a dichotomy of unequals and this invisible inequality is deliberately ignored and never quantified by `women-in-tech` groups.\r\n\r\nFOSS has a __\"diversity\"__ scarcity, a problem made more prominent due to the __lack of a CoC__, rather the reluctance to adopt one and implement it uniformly across all online FOSS communities within every country, resulting in a free pass to sexism, misogyny and online harassment, thereby directly impacting diversity. The __leaky pipeline__ problem, wherein existing women leave tech due to misogyny, harassment, subtle sexism and/or unequal pay and promotions, but are forced to remain silent due to the lack of a support system, is hardly ever accounted for. \r\n\r\nThe **[diversity-index](http://svaksha.github.io/diversity-index)** is a curated list of grants, scholarships, travel bursary and/or financial aid offered to women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) from __ALL around the world__, by conferences and companies sponsoring education to encourage diversity in STEM fields among __half the world's population__. To measure `diversity` accurately, lets first quantify __how__ much help is actually available to women across the world from the following pages:\r\n\r\n+ [di-awards.md](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/blob/master/di-awards.md) :: General grants and awards for Women in STEM, Post Doctoral Research grants and Scholarships and fellowships for women graduates interested in pursuing higher education in CS research and/or graduate studies at different Universities around the world.\r\n+ [di-conferences-events.md](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/blob/master/di-conferences-events.md) :: Track the DiversityIndex of women attending or speaking at barcamps, bootcamps, conferences, meetups, unconferences and other events thanks to financial aid and travel grants.\r\n+ [di-internships.md](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/blob/master/di-internships.md) :: Summer of Code programs and internships open to women applicants.\r\n+ [notes-speakers.md](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/blob/master/notes-speakers.md) :: Useful tips for conference speakers.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# LICENSE \r\n+ COPYRIGHT Â© 2014-Now [SVAKSHA](http://svaksha.com/pages/Bio), All Rights Reserved. \r\n+ This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License - (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) as detailed in the [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/blob/master/LICENSE.md) file and ALL references, citations, copies and forks of this work must retain the Copyright, Licence (LICENSE.md file), this permission notice and must [attribute credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Attribution).\r\n\r\n## Mirrors\r\n+ [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/svaksha/diversity-index) :: git clone git@gitlab.com:svaksha/diversity-index.git \r\n+ [Devlabs](https://gitlab.devlabs.linuxassist.net/svaksha/diversity-index) :: git clone ssh://git@gitlab.devlabs.linuxassist.net:608/svaksha/diversity-index.git\r\n\r\n## Contributing \r\nPlease submit a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index/pulls), if you wish to list any company, conference, foundation or organization that funds diversity initiatives for women.\r\n\r\n#### Guidelines for listing Events\r\n+ This is NOT a generic list of events or conferences, hence, **only those conferences/ events that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) will be listed**. \r\n+ Please dont list events that expect women to have protracted `diversity` discussions with the organizers to initiate the FA/grants programs as this places an extra burden on women to do the legwork of making their conference a success instead of `diversity` being a community effort.
