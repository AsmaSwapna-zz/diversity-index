<a id="50-diversityindex" class="anchor" href="#50-diversityindex" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>50-DiversityIndex</h1>

<p><strong><a href="http://svaksha.github.io/50-DI">50-DI</a></strong> is a curated DiversityIndex of grants, scholarships, travel bursary and/or financial aid offered to women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) from <strong>ALL around the world</strong>, by conferences and companies sponsoring education to encourage diversity in STEM fields among <strong>half the world's population</strong>. </p>

<p>Women are <strong>half</strong> the world's population and despite the uproar over the lack of <strong>diversity</strong> in the Computer Science field, they hardly get any financial support for higher studies or opportunities to attend conferences. A common myth that accompanies any "diversity" discussion is the perception that because admissions to CS studies is open to everyone, if women were really interested in programming or Math, they would enroll to study it, however, the "leaky pipeline" problem, wherein existing women leave tech due to misogyny, harassment, subtle sexism and/or unequal pay and promotions, but are forced to remain silent due to the lack of a support system, is hardly ever accounted for. </p>

<p>The "diversity" scarcity problem is a lot more prominent within FOSS where the lack of a CoC, or reluctance to adopt one and implement it uniformly across all online FOSS communities within every country, results in a free pass to sexist misogyny and online harassment, thereby directly impacting diversity. Besides this, women are highly underrepresented in senior research positions and there is an attempt to tell their stories via a book - see the <a href="http://boundaryvision.com/2014/08/27/call-for-papers-personal-stories-from-women-in-science/">CFP for personal stories from women in science</a>.</p>

<a id="track-the-international-diversity-index" class="anchor" href="#track-the-international-diversity-index" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Track the International Diversity-Index</h3>

<p>There are attempts to bridge this gap with grants inmore developed nations, especially in North America and Europe. However, this repo attempts to measure the global reality when we talk of "diversity" and "women" - words that should encompass women from ALL over the world, but a disparity of unequal proportions is created when diversity grants and financial aid are restricted to women who are citizens of the first world developed countries. Altruism to women who already enjoy facilities and privileges that women living in a third world country dont have access to, nor dream of, creates a dichotomy of unequals and this invisible inequality is deliberately ignored and never quantified by women-in-tech groups.</p>

<h4>
<a id="guidelines-for-listing-events" class="anchor" href="#guidelines-for-listing-events" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Guidelines for listing Events</h4>

<ul>
<li>This is NOT a generic list of events or conferences, hence, <strong>only those conferences/ events that explicitly publish their grants and financial aid programs for women (including those who identify as women in a way that's significant to them) will be listed</strong>. For a generic list of events and conferences, use Lanyrd.</li>
<li>Please dont list events that expect women to have protracted <code>diversity</code> discussions with the organizers to initiate the FA/grants programs as this places an extra burden on women to do the legwork of making their conference a success instead of <code>diversity</code> being a community effort. Reading <a href="https://github.com/ashedryden" class="user-mention">@ashedryden</a> 's article on "<a href="http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference">Increasing Diversity at Your Conference</a>" will give you a perspective of the challenges women in FOSS/IT face. </li>
<li>Please dont list research grants that promote ageism and discriminate and restrict applicants on the basis of age, if this information is known or publicly available. </li>
</ul>
